{"_id":"TDtDea7wKnFt6AUt","name":"Drukhari","content":"<p>The Dark Eldar, referred to more correctly as the Drukhari or \"Dark Ones\" in the Aeldari Lexicon, are a forsaken and corrupt Aeldari kindred, like their Asuryani counterparts in some ways, but vastly different in others.</p>\n<p>The Drukhari revel in piracy, enslavement, and torture, and are sadistic in the extreme. They strike with little or no warning, using an interdimensional labyrinth known as the Webway to traverse the galaxy safely and far more quickly than most advanced starfaring species can with their Warp jumps.</p>\n<p>The Drukhari are unique amongst the intelligent races of the Milky Way Galaxy because they do not live on a settled world or worlds, but rather the bulk of their population is concentrated in one foul city-state -- the Dark City of Commorragh -- that lies within the \"ordered\" Immaterium of the Aeldari Webway.</p>\n<p>The Drukhari are mainly pirates and slavers who prey on targets across the galaxy to feed their unholy appetites for other sentient beings' souls, a terrible desire called \"the Thirst,\" though they are sometimes used as mercenaries by other voidfaring species.</p>\n<p>The Drukhari are the living embodiments of all that is wanton and cruel in the Aeldari character. Highly intelligent and devious to the point of obsession, these piratical people revel in the physical and emotional pain of others, for feeding upon the psychic residue of suffering is the only way they can stave off the slow consumption by the Chaos God Slaanesh of their own souls.</p>\n<p>Unlike their Craftworld Aeldari cousins, the Drukhari do not integrate their still-powerful latent psychic abilities into their culture, and indeed have a great disdain for psykers of any kind.</p>\n<p>This is because for the Drukhari, the use of psychic abilities would only further draw the attention of \"She Who Thirsts\" (Slaanesh) upon them, and their souls are already at risk enough of being devoured by the Prince of Chaos</p>\n<h5>Drukhari Names</h5>\n<p>While sharing a common language and history with their Craftworlder cousins, the Drukhari tend to favour names with a harsher edge to them, often choosing names which symbolise the pain and terror they wish to spread.

{"_id":"k3NrlWs4AtUIynfi","name":"Squats","content":"<p>An Abhuman breed from the inhospitable high-gravity worlds near the galactic core, the Squats once ruled empires of their own. Descended from the colonists sent to mine the resource-rich worlds of that region long ago, they were cut off from humanity during the Age of Strife, and evolved to suit their environments, becoming short, solid, and hardy folk.</p>\n<p>The Squats are a tenacious, grim people, hardened by the harsh environments of their stronghold-worlds, but they’re also loyal, hard-working, and honourable, and with an intellect and technical aptitude not often found in Abhumans. Indeed, so successful were they in settling their worlds that by the time the Great Crusades discovered them, they were given permission to remain autonomous of the Imperium, as allies rather than subjects. How they achieved such a feat is lost to time. Even then, the Squats were isolationist and inward-looking, seldom involving themselves in the affairs of the wider galaxy unless the galaxy came to them.</p>\n<p>During the Age of the Imperium, the many Leagues and Strongholds of the Squats saw a slow decline, their civilisation eroded by feuds and grudge-wars, to say nothing of the malign incursions of Xenos breeds – especially the Orks, who seemed to always find the Strongholds an enticing target – and the servants of Chaos. The populations of many failing Strongholds migrated to nearby Imperial worlds, integrating into the Imperium. When the Cicatrix Maledictum opened, tearing the galaxy in two, the Squat Homeworlds were caught within the middle of the rift, and precious few of the remaining Squats survived the cataclysm. Those who remained were offworld in expeditionary groups, were those who had joined the Imperium, or were outcasts and exiles in mercenary bands, and they are far too few to rebuild what they have lost.</p>\n<p>Squats are, as their name suggests, a short, sturdy people. They tend to have hard, broad features, with prominent noses, and male Squats always bear long, thick facial hair, often elaborately braided or styled. Though shorter than most humans, their broad frames and solid bodies suggest that they are far from weak or frail – indeed, the average Squat is more resilient than a baseline human.</p>\n<h3>Squat Roles</h3>\n<p>Squats could be found in all walks of life during the days of their civilisation, and many left the Homeworlds in seek of glory, adventure, or wealth, often aligning themselves with Rogue Traders, Adeptus Mechanicus Explorators, and others who range across the stars. Now, such wandering Squats are all who remain.</p>\n<p>Many Squats are miners and prospectors by trade, but all Squats are trained and armed to defend their homes from aggressors. In addition to being hardy, they’re strong and dextrous, and with unyielding resolve, especially now that they have so little left to lose. Some Squats have taken this to extremes, swearing oaths of vengeance and ruin upon the enemies of their kind, pledging to seek the destruction of those who have harmed the Squats with their dying breaths.</p>\n<p>Squats have a natural aptitude for technology, at least compared to most in the Imperium. Anyone looking at Squat technology in detail would see many things in common with the technology of the Imperium, but also many differences. Squat Engineers and the Priesthood of Mars have a similar technological base—humanity’s technical achievements in the distant past—but they have developed these technologies differently, through different conflicts and struggles, and to suit different circumstances. Millennia of living without the strictures of the Adeptus Mechanicus allowed the Squats to develop technologies unseen within the Imperium, and Squat Master Engineers were able to rival the Magi of Mars in their artifice.</p>\n<h5>Squat Names</h5>\n<p>Many Squat names are traditional, with a recurring use of names used by honoured ancestors from generations past, and often use a patronym or matronym (the name of a parent to indicate lineage) or clan name. Squats often also have a nickname or other earned identifier. Squats don’t get to choose their own nicknames—these are given to them by mentors and superiors during their apprentice years—and young Squats are caught in the tension between standing out enough to get a worthy moniker and not being so outlandish that they receive a shameful one. The following names are examples:</p>\n<p>Algunella, Athgni, Athlun, Balgrimella, Beladokina, Burnir, Burzin, Drokgrimella, Dronglin, Elanya, Elruna, Fimagrin, Fimarun, Gadrinella, Gimzin, Grendl, Grimgrund, Grimtoka, Hakakin, Harmin, Harnina, Kazgrond, Lundor, Moranina, Mori, Odaskina, Olfmir, Ollagona, Ollanya, Ragni, Rorangona, Rorgar, Skagromina, Skoraskina, Skordokina, Snoragund, Throngana, Thuramin, Uthagrund, Zakgni</p>\n<h3>Playing a Squat</h3>\n<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 28</p>\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 5</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Toughness 3, Willpower 3</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Tech 1, Weapon Skill 2</p>\n<p><strong>Abhuman:</strong> +1DN to all Interaction tests with characters possessing the @Item[c1eM1YGFaqKckprQ]{IMPERIUM} keyword.</p>\n<p><strong>Grudges:</strong> +1d to all melee attacks against characters possessing the @Item[Vf7SDGLw2rcDMTda]{ORK} or @Item[TujuT6TkhTSvZJLF]{CHAOS} keywords. +2DN penalty on all non-hostile Interaction skill tests vs. targets possessing the @Item[Vf7SDGLw2rcDMTda]{ORK} or @Item[TujuT6TkhTSvZJLF]{CHAOS} keywords.</p>\n<p><strong>Legacy of the Cataclysm:</strong> Your Resolve and Conviction increase by +1 each. You begin play with +3 corruption.</p>\n<h5>Additional Details</h5>\n<p><strong>Age:</strong> Squats, with their hardier physiology, tend to live longer lives than baseline humans, and feel the effects of age more slowly; indeed, Squats tend to endure for a similar length of time to Adeptus Astartes, frequently living for two or three centuries if battle, mishap, or illness does not take them first, and some can live for far, far longer. If you’re randomly rolling for a Squat character’s age, roll 4d6 x 5, and then multiply the total by the game’s Tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Colouration:</strong> As an abhuman breed, Squats possess a similar range and variety of skin pigments, hair colours, and eye colours to baseline humans.</p>\n<p><strong>Height:</strong> As their name suggests, Squats are not a tall people. An average Squat stands a little over four feet tall, or around 1.3 metres. If you’re randomly rolling a Squat character’s height, roll 4’ +2d6”.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> The Guilder Dialect of the Squats diverged and evolved in isolation since long before the Imperium was ever founded, and while it may once have been based on a human language, that original language is now long dead, though some linguists have noted a possible common ancestry with the language of the tribes of Fenris. What remains is a practical, industrial language, filled with complex jargon and idioms relating to mining, machines, and warfare. Squat characters know the Guilder Dialect language in addition to any others they know.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_3l2cf55lq8r","path":"An Abundance of Apocrypha#/CF_SEP/Species","color":"#000000"}}}
{"_id":"udZRCjQtMWLW1tD6","name":"Pariah","content":"<p>Pariahs, also known as untouchables, nulls, and blanks, are a rare form of human mutant that possess no presence in the Warp. Indeed, their souls actively blot it out, disrupting psychic phenomena in their proximity and rendering them utterly impervious to psychic effects.</p>\n<p>Most sentient beings have an innate connection to the Warp, and their conscious minds and emotions are reflected within it. This echo, this signature presence, is commonly thought of as the soul by humans and Aeldari alike. Psykers—and Aeldari—have especially strong connections to the Warp, and thus their souls are bright flames in the Immaterium compared to the flickering sparks of the average human. Pariahs, however, have no connection to the Warp at all; indeed, their spirits somehow repel the Warp, like an oppressive shadow that swallows the lights nearby.</p>\n<p>In practice, this means that a pariah dampens the effects of psychic and warp-spawned powers occurring nearby. A psyker standing in the area will find their powers weakened or nullified entirely. The pariah themselves is immune to all direct psychic effects (though not indirect ones, such as having a boulder telekinetically dropped or hurled at them). They are entirely immune to daemonic possession and corruption by the powers of Chaos. They cannot be detected by most psychic means, though especially perceptive psykers may infer a pariah’s presence by the absence they produce.</p>\n<p>Ensouled beings perceive the universe as much through their immaterial spirit as through their physical senses. Many humans think of this as instinct, intuition, gut feeling, or as an ability to judge character. To such perceptions, a pariah creates a feeling of deep unease and foreboding, and even revulsion or hostility. To psykers these feelings are amplified a hundredfold, creating an instinctive disgust that borders on pain.</p>\n<p>Some pariahs feel the absence of human contact and socialisation keenly, while others are utterly without emotion. In either case, they are often driven to the fringes of society, leading short, unhappy lives: ironically, many are persecuted as witches, when nothing could be further from the truth.</p>\n<p>In particular, the Ecclesiarchy teaches that the soulless being is incapable of faith, often leading to added persecution of Pariahs as vile nonbelievers.</p>\n<h3>Pariah Roles</h3>\n<p>Though extremely rare, the Imperium seeks out pariahs to serve the Imperium. Most who are discovered are found in orphanages and similar, abandoned by parents who found themselves instinctively disgusted by their child.</p>\n<p>Those who are discovered are a rare and valuable tool in the war for humanity’s survival. The Silent Sisterhood served in this capacity during the Great Crusade and Horus Heresy, and have recently returned in a time of dire need, and both the Inquisition and the Officio Assassinorum employ them to hunt and slay witches and sorcerers.</p>\n<p>However, not all pariahs are so fortunate, and tend to live lives of isolation on the edges of society, often eking out an existence by doing solitary work, or work where the revulsion they inspire is little impediment. A few discover that the extent of their abilities and hire themselves out as freelance witch-hunters and wyrdbanes, or as bodyguards to the paranoid.</p>\n<h3>Playing a Pariah</h3>\n<p>Any Human character may be chosen to be a Pariah during character creation. This has an additional XP cost, and applies additional special abilities to the character, but it also comes with some penalties and restrictions too.</p>\n<p>This additional cost must be paid if you choose any Human archetype. It is already included in the cost of all Pariah archetypes.</p>\n<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 30</p>\n<p><strong>Abhorrent Presence:</strong> +2DN to all interaction tests with non-pariah characters. +4DN to interaction tests with @Item[JVz6FoVEc7p1DJUj]{PSYKERS}.

{"_id":"xExEDHuX7ijo2G8E","name":"Custodian","content":"<p>Where one thinks of the gene-forged warriors of the Imperium, one might imagine the Adeptus Astartes and their new Primaris Astartes brethren, and the demigod Primarchs who came before them. But they are far from the only warriors the Emperor created. The Emperor’s personal retinue, the Custodian Guard, were the result of refined gene-sculpting and alchemical engineering long before the Primarchs were created, and their design was perfected even then.</p>\n<p>Each Custodian is a unique creation. Each of them towers above even the Astartes and are said to have been almost as large as the Primarchs themselves, and their physical power and martial prowess exceed that of nearly any individual Space Marine. Yet they are not only enhanced on the physical level: their minds are as carefully wrought as their bodies.</p>\n<p>Each Custodian has a mighty intellect, with keen senses and an enhanced ability to process and understand information. Each is as much a scholar and a philosopher as a warrior, entrusted with secrets of the universe that the Emperor shared with few others, and engineered to be purely devoted to their duty to the Master of Mankind. They are profoundly vigilant, maintaining a perfect awareness of any threat to the Emperor, and they continually seek to refine their knowledge, hone their skills, and master themselves even more fully so that they do not fail in their duty again.</p>\n<h5><strong>Custodian Names</strong></h5>\n<p>The Custodes have an unusual relationship with names. Their original, true names, the ones which they bore at birth, are secret, recorded nowhere.

{"_id":"OY4oN0ugKIGn36mx","name":"Beastman","content":"<p>Often regarded as mutants, rather than Abhumans, Beastmen possess numerous bestial features. However, unlike mutants, Beastmen are relatively stable in form, and tend to possess similar features. The average Beastman has a thick hide covered in patches of wiry fur, the head of a ruminant mammal, with sturdy horns, and digitigrade legs ending in cloven hooves. They stand slightly taller and broader than the average human, and are generally stronger, faster, and more resilient, but their intellect is as close to the beasts they resemble as it is to that of humans.</p>\n<p>What they lack in intelligence, they make up for in ferocity and determination, however. They are quicktempered, and despite their resemblance to herbivores, they are decidedly carnivorous beings, and bloodthirsty ones. Many are easily swayed to the worship of Chaos, often mutating further and becoming even more monstrous. Some, however, are taught devotion to the God-Emperor, and instructed in a crude form of the Creed; these devout Beastmen believe the sin of their twisted existence and seek to atone for their shameful nature by spilling the blood of the Emperor’s enemies.</p>\n<h3>Beastman Roles</h3>\n<p>Before the Cicatrix Maledictum opened, nearly a third of the Imperium regarded Beastmen as mutants, rather than Abhumans. On most of the others, Beastmen populations were considered to be a source of itinerant labour at best. Today, their numbers are greater than ever – perhaps as some consequence of the rift’s opening – and desperate times have called for desperate measures.</p>\n<p>On those worlds which see a use for the Beastmen, they’re often used as auxiliary troops for PDF and Astra Militarum forces, driven into a zealous, flagellating frenzy and herded towards the enemy as expendable shock troops.</p>\n<p>On any other world, they’re driven to the edges and depths of society. In these places, they may find work as mercenaries and hired guns, or they may find their ways to cults devoted to the Dark Gods, where they revel in their bestial degeneracy.</p>\n<h5>Beastman Names</h5>\n<p>Beastmen tend to have either simple, descriptive Low Gothic names, or whatever guttural combinations of syllables their mouths can pronounce. The former is more common amongst “Imperial” Beastmen, while the latter is prevalent amongst those who fall outside of normal society.</p>\n<h3>Playing a Beastman</h3>\n<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 20</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Strength 3, Toughness 3</p>\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 7</p>\n<p><strong>Reviled Abhuman:</strong> +2DN to all Interaction tests with characters who do not possess the CHAOS keyword.</p>\n<p><strong>Horns:</strong> You may make melee attacks with your horns ([S]+5+2ED; AP 0).

Bestial</p>\n<p><strong>Savagery:</strong> +1d to all Intimidation tests.</p>\n<p><strong>Child of Chaos:</strong> You begin play with +3 corruption.</p>\n<h5>Additional Details</h5>\n<p><strong>Age:</strong> Beastmen tend not to live out their natural lifespan, as most are killed or die off far younger than that, whether through battle or mishap. Beastmen reach maturity relatively quickly, and they are forced to either learn how to survive quickly or be denied the opportunity. If determining a Beastman character’s age randomly, roll 3d6 + 10 and multiply the total by the game’s Tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Colouration:</strong> Beastmen tend to have fur in the same range of colours as human hair, though darker colours are more common (roll twice for hair colour and choose the lowest). Their eyes vary between human colourations and more savage-appearing crimson or amber eyes.</p>\n<p><strong>Height:</strong> Beastmen tend to stand a similar height to baseline humans, though their gait (having hooves) and their horns often make them appear taller.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> Beastmen are barely equipped to speak Low Gothic, though they can manage a mangled rendition of it through mouths not well-suited to speech.

But they are far from the only warriors the Emperor created. The Emperor’s personal retinue, the Custodian Guard, were the result of refined gene-sculpting and alchemical engineering long before the Primarchs were created, and their design was perfected even then.</p>\n<p>Each Custodian is a unique creation. Each of them towers above even the Astartes and are said to have been almost as large as the Primarchs themselves, and their physical power and martial prowess exceed that of nearly any individual Space Marine. Yet they are not only enhanced on the physical level: their minds are as carefully wrought as their bodies.</p>\n<p>Each Custodian has a mighty intellect, with keen senses and an enhanced ability to process and understand information. Each is as much a scholar and a philosopher as a warrior, entrusted with secrets of the universe that the Emperor shared with few others, and engineered to be purely devoted to their duty to the Master of Mankind.

They strike with little or no warning, using an interdimensional labyrinth known as the Webway to traverse the galaxy safely and far more quickly than most advanced starfaring species can with their Warp jumps.</p>\n<p>The Drukhari are unique amongst the intelligent races of the Milky Way Galaxy because they do not live on a settled world or worlds, but rather the bulk of their population is concentrated in one foul city-state -- the Dark City of Commorragh -- that lies within the \"ordered\" Immaterium of the Aeldari Webway.</p>\n<p>The Drukhari are mainly pirates and slavers who prey on targets across the galaxy to feed their unholy appetites for other sentient beings' souls, a terrible desire called \"the Thirst,\" though they are sometimes used as mercenaries by other voidfaring species.</p>\n<p>The Drukhari are the living embodiments of all that is wanton and cruel in the Aeldari character. Highly intelligent and devious to the point of obsession, these piratical people revel in the physical and emotional pain of others, for feeding upon the psychic residue of suffering is the only way they can stave off the slow consumption by the Chaos God Slaanesh of their own souls.</p>\n<p>Unlike their Craftworld Aeldari cousins, the Drukhari do not integrate their still-powerful latent psychic abilities into their culture, and indeed have a great disdain for psykers of any kind.</p>\n<p>This is because for the Drukhari, the use of psychic abilities would only further draw the attention of \"She Who Thirsts\" (Slaanesh) upon them, and their souls are already at risk enough of being devoured by the Prince of Chaos</p>\n<h5>Drukhari Names</h5>\n<p>While sharing a common language and history with their Craftworlder cousins, the Drukhari tend to favour names with a harsher edge to them, often choosing names which symbolise the pain and terror they wish to spread.

{"_id":"udZRCjQtMWLW1tD6","name":"Pariah","content":"<p>Pariahs, also known as untouchables, nulls, and blanks, are a rare form of human mutant that possess no presence in the Warp. Indeed, their souls actively blot it out, disrupting psychic phenomena in their proximity and rendering them utterly impervious to psychic effects.</p>\n<p>Most sentient beings have an innate connection to the Warp, and their conscious minds and emotions are reflected within it. This echo, this signature presence, is commonly thought of as the soul by humans and Aeldari alike. Psykers—and Aeldari—have especially strong connections to the Warp, and thus their souls are bright flames in the Immaterium compared to the flickering sparks of the average human. Pariahs, however, have no connection to the Warp at all; indeed, their spirits somehow repel the Warp, like an oppressive shadow that swallows the lights nearby.</p>\n<p>In practice, this means that a pariah dampens the effects of psychic and warp-spawned powers occurring nearby. A psyker standing in the area will find their powers weakened or nullified entirely. The pariah themselves is immune to all direct psychic effects (though not indirect ones, such as having a boulder telekinetically dropped or hurled at them). They are entirely immune to daemonic possession and corruption by the powers of Chaos. They cannot be detected by most psychic means, though especially perceptive psykers may infer a pariah’s presence by the absence they produce.</p>\n<p>Ensouled beings perceive the universe as much through their immaterial spirit as through their physical senses. Many humans think of this as instinct, intuition, gut feeling, or as an ability to judge character. To such perceptions, a pariah creates a feeling of deep unease and foreboding, and even revulsion or hostility. To psykers these feelings are amplified a hundredfold, creating an instinctive disgust that borders on pain.</p>\n<p>Some pariahs feel the absence of human contact and socialisation keenly, while others are utterly without emotion. In either case, they are often driven to the fringes of society, leading short, unhappy lives: ironically, many are persecuted as witches, when nothing could be further from the truth.</p>\n<p>In particular, the Ecclesiarchy teaches that the soulless being is incapable of faith, often leading to added persecution of Pariahs as vile nonbelievers.</p>\n<h3>Pariah Roles</h3>\n<p>Though extremely rare, the Imperium seeks out pariahs to serve the Imperium. Most who are discovered are found in orphanages and similar, abandoned by parents who found themselves instinctively disgusted by their child.</p>\n<p>Those who are discovered are a rare and valuable tool in the war for humanity’s survival. The Silent Sisterhood served in this capacity during the Great Crusade and Horus Heresy, and have recently returned in a time of dire need, and both the Inquisition and the Officio Assassinorum employ them to hunt and slay witches and sorcerers.</p>\n<p>However, not all pariahs are so fortunate, and tend to live lives of isolation on the edges of society, often eking out an existence by doing solitary work, or work where the revulsion they inspire is little impediment. A few discover that the extent of their abilities and hire themselves out as freelance witch-hunters and wyrdbanes, or as bodyguards to the paranoid.</p>\n<h3>Playing a Pariah</h3>\n<p>Any Human character may be chosen to be a Pariah during character creation.

{"_id":"k3NrlWs4AtUIynfi","name":"Squats","content":"<p>An Abhuman breed from the inhospitable high-gravity worlds near the galactic core, the Squats once ruled empires of their own. Descended from the colonists sent to mine the resource-rich worlds of that region long ago, they were cut off from humanity during the Age of Strife, and evolved to suit their environments, becoming short, solid, and hardy folk.</p>\n<p>The Squats are a tenacious, grim people, hardened by the harsh environments of their stronghold-worlds, but they’re also loyal, hard-working, and honourable, and with an intellect and technical aptitude not often found in Abhumans. Indeed, so successful were they in settling their worlds that by the time the Great Crusades discovered them, they were given permission to remain autonomous of the Imperium, as allies rather than subjects. How they achieved such a feat is lost to time. Even then, the Squats were isolationist and inward-looking, seldom involving themselves in the affairs of the wider galaxy unless the galaxy came to them.</p>\n<p>During the Age of the Imperium, the many Leagues and Strongholds of the Squats saw a slow decline, their civilisation eroded by feuds and grudge-wars, to say nothing of the malign incursions of Xenos breeds – especially the Orks, who seemed to always find the Strongholds an enticing target – and the servants of Chaos. The populations of many failing Strongholds migrated to nearby Imperial worlds, integrating into the Imperium. When the Cicatrix Maledictum opened, tearing the galaxy in two, the Squat Homeworlds were caught within the middle of the rift, and precious few of the remaining Squats survived the cataclysm. Those who remained were offworld in expeditionary groups, were those who had joined the Imperium, or were outcasts and exiles in mercenary bands, and they are far too few to rebuild what they have lost.</p>\n<p>Squats are, as their name suggests, a short, sturdy people. They tend to have hard, broad features, with prominent noses, and male Squats always bear long, thick facial hair, often elaborately braided or styled. Though shorter than most humans, their broad frames and solid bodies suggest that they are far from weak or frail – indeed, the average Squat is more resilient than a baseline human.</p>\n<h3>Squat Roles</h3>\n<p>Squats could be found in all walks of life during the days of their civilisation, and many left the Homeworlds in seek of glory, adventure, or wealth, often aligning themselves with Rogue Traders, Adeptus Mechanicus Explorators, and others who range across the stars. Now, such wandering Squats are all who remain.</p>\n<p>Many Squats are miners and prospectors by trade, but all Squats are trained and armed to defend their homes from aggressors. In addition to being hardy, they’re strong and dextrous, and with unyielding resolve, especially now that they have so little left to lose. Some Squats have taken this to extremes, swearing oaths of vengeance and ruin upon the enemies of their kind, pledging to seek the destruction of those who have harmed the Squats with their dying breaths.</p>\n<p>Squats have a natural aptitude for technology, at least compared to most in the Imperium. Anyone looking at Squat technology in detail would see many things in common with the technology of the Imperium, but also many differences. Squat Engineers and the Priesthood of Mars have a similar technological base—humanity’s technical achievements in the distant past—but they have developed these technologies differently, through different conflicts and struggles, and to suit different circumstances. Millennia of living without the strictures of the Adeptus Mechanicus allowed the Squats to develop technologies unseen within the Imperium, and Squat Master Engineers were able to rival the Magi of Mars in their artifice.</p>\n<h5>Squat Names</h5>\n<p>Many Squat names are traditional, with a recurring use of names used by honoured ancestors from generations past, and often use a patronym or matronym (the name of a parent to indicate lineage) or clan name. Squats often also have a nickname or other earned identifier. Squats don’t get to choose their own nicknames—these are given to them by mentors and superiors during their apprentice years—and young Squats are caught in the tension between standing out enough to get a worthy moniker and not being so outlandish that they receive a shameful one. The following names are examples:</p>\n<p>Algunella, Athgni, Athlun, Balgrimella, Beladokina, Burnir, Burzin, Drokgrimella, Dronglin, Elanya, Elruna, Fimagrin, Fimarun, Gadrinella, Gimzin, Grendl, Grimgrund, Grimtoka, Hakakin, Harmin, Harnina, Kazgrond, Lundor, Moranina, Mori, Odaskina, Olfmir, Ollagona, Ollanya, Ragni, Rorangona, Rorgar, Skagromina, Skoraskina, Skordokina, Snoragund, Throngana, Thuramin, Uthagrund, Zakgni</p>\n<h3>Playing a Squat</h3>\n<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 28</p>\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 5</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Toughness 3, Willpower 3</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Tech 1, Weapon Skill 2</p>\n<p><strong>Abhuman:</strong> +1DN to all Interaction tests with characters possessing the @Item[c1eM1YGFaqKckprQ]{IMPERIUM} keyword.</p>\n<p><strong>Grudges:</strong> +1d to all melee attacks against characters possessing the @Item[Vf7SDGLw2rcDMTda]{ORK} or @Item[TujuT6TkhTSvZJLF]{CHAOS} keywords. +2DN penalty on all non-hostile Interaction skill tests vs. targets possessing the @Item[Vf7SDGLw2rcDMTda]{ORK} or @Item[TujuT6TkhTSvZJLF]{CHAOS} keywords.</p>\n<p><strong>Legacy of the Cataclysm:</strong> Your Resolve and Conviction increase by +1 each. You begin play with +3 corruption.</p>\n<h5>Additional Details</h5>\n<p><strong>Age:</strong> Squats, with their hardier physiology, tend to live longer lives than baseline humans, and feel the effects of age more slowly; indeed, Squats tend to endure for a similar length of time to Adeptus Astartes, frequently living for two or three centuries if battle, mishap, or illness does not take them first, and some can live for far, far longer. If you’re randomly rolling for a Squat character’s age, roll 4d6 x 5, and then multiply the total by the game’s Tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Colouration:</strong> As an abhuman breed, Squats possess a similar range and variety of skin pigments, hair colours, and eye colours to baseline humans.</p>\n<p><strong>Height:</strong> As their name suggests, Squats are not a tall people. An average Squat stands a little over four feet tall, or around 1.3 metres. If you’re randomly rolling a Squat character’s height, roll 4’ +2d6”.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> The Guilder Dialect of the Squats diverged and evolved in isolation since long before the Imperium was ever founded, and while it may once have been based on a human language, that original language is now long dead, though some linguists have noted a possible common ancestry with the language of the tribes of Fenris. What remains is a practical, industrial language, filled with complex jargon and idioms relating to mining, machines, and warfare. Squat characters know the Guilder Dialect language in addition to any others they know.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_3l2cf55lq8r","path":"An Abundance of Apocrypha#/CF_SEP/Species","color":"#000000"}}}
{"_id":"w0KxIbY9d8O5U5eN","name":"The T'au","content":"<p>The T’au—also known as the Tau in older Imperial records—are a relatively recent humanoid Xenos species native to a world in the Eastern Fringe of the galaxy. They are an intelligent and technologically advanced species with an emergent colonial empire that has spread across several adjacent sectors of space over the past centuries, using a mixture of conquest and diplomacy to expand their influence and territory.</p>\n<p>T’au society is divided into several functional castes, each of which is responsible for a single aspect of society. These castes are reinforced through strict eugenic breeding programs, maintaining each caste as a physiologically distinct subspecies.</p>\n<p>The T’au believe in the concept of the <em>Tau’va</em>, a philosophy of all individuals working together to the collective betterment of all, placing the wellbeing of their society above their individual needs or desires.</p>\n<p>T’au player characters will belong to one of five Castes, each of which are suited to different roles within society. In game terms, each Caste is a different species; a <em>Shas</em> T’au cannot choose an archetype for <em>Fio</em> T’au, and vice versa.</p>\n<h5>T'au Names</h5>\n<p>T'au names are tied closely with their lives within the empire. A T'au's full name always starts with their caste and their rank, followed by the sept (planetary system) of their birth, followed by their personal name, which is often determined/extended by their notable actions or achievements in life. In common speech, they may be referred to by a nickname or by their rank and one of their personal names, rather than speaking the full name each time: the rebel Shas’O Vior’la Shovah Kais Mont’yr was also known as O’Shovah, or Commander Farsight.</p>\n<p>A T’au character at Tier 1 will only have their caste, rank, and maybe a single personal name. At Tier 2, they will have gained their first personal name, if they didn’t have it before. At Tier 3 or 4, a T’au will likely have received their second personal name. T’au with three or more personal names are likely to be Tier 5 or higher.</p>\n<h3>Playing a Tau</h3>\n<h4>Fire Caste T'au</h4>\n<p>Members of the Fire Caste—the <em>Shas</em>—are the warriors of the Tau Empire, and as such are most often seen on the field of battle. They have been bred to be the strongest and most aggressive Tau, and weak strains are quickly weeded out. These traits come from the Fire Caste's origin on the plains of T'au, where they were hunters and warriors. Fire Warriors, as soldiers of the Fire Caste are known, spend their entire lifetimes in battle or preparing for it, constantly honing their tactics, and working to improve their skills. The strongest of the strong are those Tau from the world of Vior'la, who have slightly greater muscle mass because of the stronger gravity of that planet. The Fire Caste guided by the Code of Fire—a doctrine of loyalty, martial arts and merciless war tempered by wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 4</p>\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Ballistic Skill 1, Tech 1</p>\n<p><strong>For the Greater Good (Shas):</strong> When you assist an ally using Awareness, Ballistic Skill, or Stealth, you may halve the number of dice you would add and add that many Icons to the test you are assisting.</p>\n<p><strong>Dull Soul:</strong> You cannot gain the @Item[JVz6FoVEc7p1DJUj]{PSYKER} keyword under any circumstances.</p>\n<h4>Earth Caste T'au</h4>\n<p>The Earth caste—the <em>Fio</em>—provides for the manufacturing, agricultural, industrial, artisans, and engineering needs of the Tau Empire. By far the largest caste in sheer numbers, it is they who erect dwellings, provide food, and produce new technology. Members of the Earth Caste are often described as plain and dour, possessing a rather stoic outlook on life in general. They were originally the first Tau to build cities and practice agriculture. </p>\n<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 14</p>\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 5</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Intellect 3</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Scholar 1, Tech 1</p>\n<p><strong>For the Greater Good (Fio):</strong> When you assist an ally using Medicae, Scholar, or Tech, you may halve the number of dice you would add and add that many Icons to the test you are assisting</p>\n<p><strong>Dull Soul:</strong> You cannot gain the @Item[JVz6FoVEc7p1DJUj]{PSYKER} keyword under any circumstances.</p>\n<h4>Air Caste T'au</h4>\n<p>The Air Caste—the <em>Kor</em>—is charged with holding the Tau Empire together through the Kor'vattra, the Tau Empire's merchant and war-fleet in addition to operating Tau Orbitals and Fortress Stations. Formerly functioning as messengers, these days they are the Tau Navy and are sometimes called the \"Invisible Caste\", for they rarely if ever set foot upon planets. Living in Orbital Cities, Tau of the Air Caste are the tallest and most slender of all Tau, with long, skinny limbs and hollow bones developed due to lives lived mostly in low- and zero-gravity ships and space stations. In the past, before the time of the Mont'au, the Tau that originally became the Air Caste had membranes stretching between their limbs, allowing them to glide on air currents. Tau pilots tend to be superior pilots compared to their human counterparts because they have a better depth perception and higher G-tolerance, but they lack battle-experience compared to the best Imperial fighter-pilots. </p>\n<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 14</p>\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 7</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 3</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Awareness 1, Pilot 1</p>\n<p><strong>For the Greater Good (Kor):</strong> When you assist an ally using Awareness, Pilot, or Tech, you may halve the number of dice you would add and add that many Icons to the test you are assisting.

They interact with other races when such affairs are not handled by the Fire Caste, and often act as administrators of Tau worlds in the absence of an Ethereal governor. Like water, Water Caste bureaucrats fluidly move between other Castes and alien races incorporated within the Empire to make sure that it flows smoothly. The Water Caste are known for their great linguistic, diplomatic, and negotiation skills. Members of the Water Caste are often the ones who initiate first contact with new species encountered by the Empire, skilfully negotiating their union with the Tau. The members of the Water Caste has a gift for linguistics that has become more and more developed over time, so they able to learn alien languages with ease and show a remarkable ability to emulate and pick up subtlest of communication features.</p>\n<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 14</p>\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Fellowship 3</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Insight 1, Persuasion 1</p>\n<p><strong>For the Greater Good (Por)</strong>: When you assist an ally using Cunning, Deception, or Persuasion, you may halve the number of dice you would add and add that many Icons to the test you are assisting.

When you encounter an unfamiliar language, you gain +Double Rank on Scholar tests to learn or translate that language.</p>\n<p><strong>Dull Soul:</strong> You cannot gain the @Item[JVz6FoVEc7p1DJUj]{PSYKER} keyword under any circumstances.</p>\n<h4>Ethereal Caste T'au</h4>\n<p>The Ethereal Caste—the <em>Aun</em>—are the leaders of T’au society, serving as some mixture of philosopher-kings and spiritual leaders. Their arrival started the unification process between the various Tau tribes and coincided with the implementation of the concept of the Greater Good. They first appeared during a siege between the Tau of the plains (later known as the Fire Caste) and the Tau of the city of Fio'taun (later known as the Earth Caste). The Ethereals brought the two sides together to negotiate and convinced them to follow the Greater Good. Their power over the Tau is such that an Ethereal could tell a Tau to die and that Tau would do so quickly and gladly.</p>\n<p>As the leaders of the Tau, the Ethereals are enigmatic and studious, yet unfaltering in their authority and their drive to further the Greater Good. They are mystics and philosophers, possessed of knowledge and wisdom not shared by their more practical subjects. As such they had some part to play in the Tau rapid development, and to this day guide their species in its dynamic expansion, or the castes revert to the savagery that once threatened to destroy them.</p>\n<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 40</p>\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 3, Willpower 3</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Leadership 2, Scholar 3, Weapon Skill 1</p>\n<p><strong>Ethereal Presence:</strong> @Item[F7FRdD4PlRSmS3xN]{T'AU} characters within 12m always add bonus dice equal to twice the Ethereal’s Rank to their Resolve and Conviction tests. @Item[F7FRdD4PlRSmS3xN]{T'AU} characters cannot willingly harm an Ethereal, and must pass a DN 5 Resolve test or become Pinned if their actions allow an Ethereal to be harmed.</p>\n<p><strong>Dull Soul:</strong> You cannot gain the @Item[JVz6FoVEc7p1DJUj]{PSYKER} keyword under any circumstances.</p>\n<h5>Additional Details</h5>\n<p><strong>Age:</strong> T’au live slightly shorter lives than baseline humans, aging to maturity by around 8 Tau’cyr (a T’au unit of time, roughly equal to a year). And rarely living for longer than 40 or 50 Tau’cyr, though some valuable T’au leaders and experts are interred in stasis pods or receive experimental treatments or implants to extend their lives, and Ethereals appear to live somewhat longer than other T’au. If you’re randomly rolling for a T'au character’s age, roll 1d6+6, and then add an additional d6 for each Tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Colouration:</strong> T’au have skin in various shades of bluegrey—some more grey, some more blue. Their eyes tend to be large dark orbs, with little distinct colouration. Their hair tends to be carefully maintained, normally shaven except for a single scalplock, and tend to be various shades of red, brown, or black, though turning grey or white with age.</p>\n<p><strong>Height:</strong> T’au height varies significantly by caste. Air Caste T’au are the tallest, at 7’ +2d6”. Fire, Water, and Ethereal Caste T’au are all similar in height, averaging 4’ + 5d6”, slightly shorter than a human. Earth Caste T’au are especially short and broad, averaging 4’ + 4d6”.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> The T’au speak their own language, typically referred to as “T’au” by the Imperium. This language is well-known to Imperial xenolinguists, as the T’au Water Caste are quite free with translation guides to aid interactions (though those same T’au diplomats also speak Imperial Gothic extremely well). This agglutinative language—a language where new words are built by combining existing words—is extremely adaptable to the rapid growth of the T’au Empire, and new concepts are added or developed regularly. Each Caste has their own highly developed dialects replete with distinctive jargon and specialised colloquialisms. The Earth Caste are also fluent in the complex octal machine-languages of their Drone assistants.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_3l2cf55lq8r","path":"An Abundance of Apocrypha#/CF_SEP/Species","color":"#000000"}}}
