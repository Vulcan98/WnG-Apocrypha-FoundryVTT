{"_id":"xExEDHuX7ijo2G8E","name":"Custodian","content":"<p>Where one thinks of the gene-forged warriors of the Imperium, one might imagine the Adeptus Astartes and their new Primaris Astartes brethren, and the demigod Primarchs who came before them. But they are far from the only warriors the Emperor created. The Emperor’s personal retinue, the Custodian Guard, were the result of refined gene-sculpting and alchemical engineering long before the Primarchs were created, and their design was perfected even then.</p>\n<p>Each Custodian is a unique creation. Each of them towers above even the Astartes and are said to have been almost as large as the Primarchs themselves, and their physical power and martial prowess exceed that of nearly any individual Space Marine. Yet they are not only enhanced on the physical level: their minds are as carefully wrought as their bodies.</p>\n<p>Each Custodian has a mighty intellect, with keen senses and an enhanced ability to process and understand information. Each is as much a scholar and a philosopher as a warrior, entrusted with secrets of the universe that the Emperor shared with few others, and engineered to be purely devoted to their duty to the Master of Mankind. They are profoundly vigilant, maintaining a perfect awareness of any threat to the Emperor, and they continually seek to refine their knowledge, hone their skills, and master themselves even more fully so that they do not fail in their duty again.</p>\n<h5><strong>Custodian Names</strong></h5>\n<p>The Custodes have an unusual relationship with names. Their original, true names, the ones which they bore at birth, are secret, recorded nowhere. Instead, each Custodian answers to a name of their choosing, often some moniker of note from Terran history or legend. Each accepts additional names throughout their lives, etched microscopically within their armour as a testament to their accomplishments; the mightiest Custodians may have dozens, even hundreds of names. Examples include:</p>\n<p>Tybalus, Aetheus, Dalat, Kariyan, Basillaeus, Tristraen, Erasmian, Heracal, Tauramacchis, Nurthias, Hasturias, Artoris, Nathadian, Io, Harkhas, Constantin, Eratorius, Archimallus.</p>\n<h3><strong>Playing a Custodian</strong></h3>\n<p>If you wish to play a Custodian character, use the following species entry.</p>\n<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 330</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 5, Fellowship 3, Initiative 5, Intellect 3, Strength 6, Toughness 6, Willpower 3</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Athletics 4, Awareness 5, Ballistic Skill 4, Insight 3, Scholar 2, Stealth 3, Weapon Skill 4</p>\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 7</p>\n<p><strong>Aegis of the Emperor:</strong> A Custodian may roll Determination against Mortal Wounds. Indomitable, Incorruptible: You add +2 to your Resolve, and you automatically succeed on all Corruption Tests. Your Maximum Wounds are increased by +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Solitary:</strong> A Custodian maintains a unique pool of Glory. They may save up to 3 points of Glory, and they cannot save points into the group pool nor can they spend Glory generated by anyone else.</p>\n<p><strong>Despised by the Unholy:</strong> If a Custodian is present in a game, the GM’s starting and maximum Ruin are increased by 1.</p>\n<h5><strong>Additional Details </strong></h5>\n<p><strong>Age:</strong> Custodes are functionally immortal and will persist for centuries or millennia if not slain through extreme violence. If you’re randomly rolling for a Custodian character’s age, roll 4d6 x 5, and then multiply the total by the game’s Tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Colouration:</strong> As transhumans, Custodians possess a similar range and variety of skin pigments, hair colours, and eye colours to baseline humans.</p>\n<p><strong>Height:</strong> Custodians typically stand taller than the Astartes and are close in height to the Primarchs of old. If you’re randomly rolling a Custodian character’s height, roll 8’ +2d6”.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> The Custodians speak Low Gothic and High Gothic and are often fluent in numerous obscure historical human languages, as well as other forms of communication, including the Thoughtmark and Battlemark sign languages used by the Silent Sisterhood, and Astartes battle-sign.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_3l2cf55lq8r","path":"An Abundance of Apocrypha#/CF_SEP/Species","color":"#000000"}}}
{"_id":"TDtDea7wKnFt6AUt","name":"Drukhari","content":"<p>The Dark Eldar, referred to more correctly as the Drukhari or \"Dark Ones\" in the Aeldari Lexicon, are a forsaken and corrupt Aeldari kindred, like their Asuryani counterparts in some ways, but vastly different in others.</p>\n<p>The Drukhari revel in piracy, enslavement, and torture, and are sadistic in the extreme. They strike with little or no warning, using an interdimensional labyrinth known as the Webway to traverse the galaxy safely and far more quickly than most advanced starfaring species can with their Warp jumps.</p>\n<p>The Drukhari are unique amongst the intelligent races of the Milky Way Galaxy because they do not live on a settled world or worlds, but rather the bulk of their population is concentrated in one foul city-state -- the Dark City of Commorragh -- that lies within the \"ordered\" Immaterium of the Aeldari Webway.</p>\n<p>The Drukhari are mainly pirates and slavers who prey on targets across the galaxy to feed their unholy appetites for other sentient beings' souls, a terrible desire called \"the Thirst,\" though they are sometimes used as mercenaries by other voidfaring species.</p>\n<p>The Drukhari are the living embodiments of all that is wanton and cruel in the Aeldari character. Highly intelligent and devious to the point of obsession, these piratical people revel in the physical and emotional pain of others, for feeding upon the psychic residue of suffering is the only way they can stave off the slow consumption by the Chaos God Slaanesh of their own souls.</p>\n<p>Unlike their Craftworld Aeldari cousins, the Drukhari do not integrate their still-powerful latent psychic abilities into their culture, and indeed have a great disdain for psykers of any kind.</p>\n<p>This is because for the Drukhari, the use of psychic abilities would only further draw the attention of \"She Who Thirsts\" (Slaanesh) upon them, and their souls are already at risk enough of being devoured by the Prince of Chaos</p>\n<h5>Drukhari Names</h5>\n<p>While sharing a common language and history with their Craftworlder cousins, the Drukhari tend to favour names with a harsher edge to them, often choosing names which symbolise the pain and terror they wish to spread. Examples include:</p>\n<p>Akhirion, Anarkyss, Anielyn, Bekliel, Ethrilliac, Grendett, Grevyth, Kylos, Laelanyel, Madrax, Melikka, Mellyx, Monsatos, Narlek, Nyktos, Peiythia, Phyrix, Selithrian, Theskril, Thessa, Thraed, Thresyn, Thrixxesh, Quaez, Uless, Vrexith, Vylekh, Vypus, Xela, Xurul</p>\n<h3>Playing a Drukhari</h3>\n<p>If you wish to play a Drukhari character, use the following species entry instead of the normal Aeldari one.</p>\n<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 20</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 3, Strength 2</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Intimidation 2</p>\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Blade Artist:</strong> When you make an attack with a melee weapon, increase the weapon’s AP by 1 (i.e., from -1 to -2) if you shift one or more Icons on the attack. This stacks with effects such as the Rending weapon trait.</p>\n<p><strong>The Thirst:</strong> You cannot recover Shock by spending Wrath, or through the Medicae skill. However, you recover 1d3+Rank shock whenever you inflict Shock on an opponent, kill an opponent, whenever you succeed at an Intimidation interaction attack, or when an enemy fails a Resolve test. The GM gains +1 Ruin whenever you become Exhausted.</p>\n<p><strong>She Who Thirsts:</strong> Reduce your Maximum Shock by an amount equal to your Corruption Level.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_3l2cf55lq8r","path":"An Abundance of Apocrypha#/CF_SEP/Species","color":"#000000"}}}

{"_id":"xExEDHuX7ijo2G8E","name":"Custodian","content":"<p>Where one thinks of the gene-forged warriors of the Imperium, one might imagine the Adeptus Astartes and their new Primaris Astartes brethren, and the demigod Primarchs who came before them. But they are far from the only warriors the Emperor created. The Emperor’s personal retinue, the Custodian Guard, were the result of refined gene-sculpting and alchemical engineering long before the Primarchs were created, and their design was perfected even then.</p>\n<p>Each Custodian is a unique creation. Each of them towers above even the Astartes and are said to have been almost as large as the Primarchs themselves, and their physical power and martial prowess exceed that of nearly any individual Space Marine. Yet they are not only enhanced on the physical level: their minds are as carefully wrought as their bodies.</p>\n<p>Each Custodian has a mighty intellect, with keen senses and an enhanced ability to process and understand information. Each is as much a scholar and a philosopher as a warrior, entrusted with secrets of the universe that the Emperor shared with few others, and engineered to be purely devoted to their duty to the Master of Mankind. They are profoundly vigilant, maintaining a perfect awareness of any threat to the Emperor, and they continually seek to refine their knowledge, hone their skills, and master themselves even more fully so that they do not fail in their duty again.</p>\n<h5><strong>Custodian Names</strong></h5>\n<p>The Custodes have an unusual relationship with names. Their original, true names, the ones which they bore at birth, are secret, recorded nowhere. Instead, each Custodian answers to a name of their choosing, often some moniker of note from Terran history or legend. Each accepts additional names throughout their lives, etched microscopically within their armour as a testament to their accomplishments; the mightiest Custodians may have dozens, even hundreds of names. Examples include:</p>\n<p>Tybalus, Aetheus, Dalat, Kariyan, Basillaeus, Tristraen, Erasmian, Heracal, Tauramacchis, Nurthias, Hasturias, Artoris, Nathadian, Io, Harkhas, Constantin, Eratorius, Archimallus.</p>\n<h3><strong>Playing a Custodian</strong></h3>\n<p>If you wish to play a Custodian character, use the following species entry.</p>\n<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 330</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 5, Fellowship 3, Initiative 5, Intellect 3, Strength 6, Toughness 6, Willpower 3</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Athletics 4, Awareness 5, Ballistic Skill 4, Insight 3, Scholar 2, Stealth 3, Weapon Skill 4</p>\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 7</p>\n<p><strong>Aegis of the Emperor:</strong> A Custodian may roll Determination against Mortal Wounds. Indomitable, Incorruptible: You add +2 to your Resolve, and you automatically succeed on all Corruption Tests.

They may save up to 3 points of Glory, and they cannot save points into the group pool nor can they spend Glory generated by anyone else.</p>\n<p><strong>Despised by the Unholy:</strong> If a Custodian is present in a game, the GM’s starting and maximum Ruin are increased by 1.</p>\n<h5><strong>Additional Details </strong></h5>\n<p><strong>Age:</strong> Custodes are functionally immortal and will persist for centuries or millennia if not slain through extreme violence. If you’re randomly rolling for a Custodian character’s age, roll 4d6 x 5, and then multiply the total by the game’s Tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Colouration:</strong> As transhumans, Custodians possess a similar range and variety of skin pigments, hair colours, and eye colours to baseline humans.</p>\n<p><strong>Height:</strong> Custodians typically stand taller than the Astartes and are close in height to the Primarchs of old. If you’re randomly rolling a Custodian character’s height, roll 8’ +2d6”.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> The Custodians speak Low Gothic and High Gothic and are often fluent in numerous obscure historical human languages, as well as other forms of communication, including the Thoughtmark and Battlemark sign languages used by the Silent Sisterhood, and Astartes battle-sign.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_3l2cf55lq8r","path":"An Abundance of Apocrypha#/CF_SEP/Species","color":"#000000"}}}

They strike with little or no warning, using an interdimensional labyrinth known as the Webway to traverse the galaxy safely and far more quickly than most advanced starfaring species can with their Warp jumps.</p>\n<p>The Drukhari are unique amongst the intelligent races of the Milky Way Galaxy because they do not live on a settled world or worlds, but rather the bulk of their population is concentrated in one foul city-state -- the Dark City of Commorragh -- that lies within the \"ordered\" Immaterium of the Aeldari Webway.</p>\n<p>The Drukhari are mainly pirates and slavers who prey on targets across the galaxy to feed their unholy appetites for other sentient beings' souls, a terrible desire called \"the Thirst,\" though they are sometimes used as mercenaries by other voidfaring species.</p>\n<p>The Drukhari are the living embodiments of all that is wanton and cruel in the Aeldari character. Highly intelligent and devious to the point of obsession, these piratical people revel in the physical and emotional pain of others, for feeding upon the psychic residue of suffering is the only way they can stave off the slow consumption by the Chaos God Slaanesh of their own souls.</p>\n<p>Unlike their Craftworld Aeldari cousins, the Drukhari do not integrate their still-powerful latent psychic abilities into their culture, and indeed have a great disdain for psykers of any kind.</p>\n<p>This is because for the Drukhari, the use of psychic abilities would only further draw the attention of \"She Who Thirsts\" (Slaanesh) upon them, and their souls are already at risk enough of being devoured by the Prince of Chaos</p>\n<h5>Drukhari Names</h5>\n<p>While sharing a common language and history with their Craftworlder cousins, the Drukhari tend to favour names with a harsher edge to them, often choosing names which symbolise the pain and terror they wish to spread.

{"_id":"udZRCjQtMWLW1tD6","name":"Pariah","content":"<p>Pariahs, also known as untouchables, nulls, and blanks, are a rare form of human mutant that possess no presence in the Warp. Indeed, their souls actively blot it out, disrupting psychic phenomena in their proximity and rendering them utterly impervious to psychic effects.</p>\n<p>Most sentient beings have an innate connection to the Warp, and their conscious minds and emotions are reflected within it. This echo, this signature presence, is commonly thought of as the soul by humans and Aeldari alike. Psykers—and Aeldari—have especially strong connections to the Warp, and thus their souls are bright flames in the Immaterium compared to the flickering sparks of the average human. Pariahs, however, have no connection to the Warp at all; indeed, their spirits somehow repel the Warp, like an oppressive shadow that swallows the lights nearby.</p>\n<p>In practice, this means that a pariah dampens the effects of psychic and warp-spawned powers occurring nearby. A psyker standing in the area will find their powers weakened or nullified entirely. The pariah themselves is immune to all direct psychic effects (though not indirect ones, such as having a boulder telekinetically dropped or hurled at them). They are entirely immune to daemonic possession and corruption by the powers of Chaos. They cannot be detected by most psychic means, though especially perceptive psykers may infer a pariah’s presence by the absence they produce.</p>\n<p>Ensouled beings perceive the universe as much through their immaterial spirit as through their physical senses. Many humans think of this as instinct, intuition, gut feeling, or as an ability to judge character. To such perceptions, a pariah creates a feeling of deep unease and foreboding, and even revulsion or hostility. To psykers these feelings are amplified a hundredfold, creating an instinctive disgust that borders on pain.</p>\n<p>Some pariahs feel the absence of human contact and socialisation keenly, while others are utterly without emotion. In either case, they are often driven to the fringes of society, leading short, unhappy lives: ironically, many are persecuted as witches, when nothing could be further from the truth.</p>\n<p>In particular, the Ecclesiarchy teaches that the soulless being is incapable of faith, often leading to added persecution of Pariahs as vile nonbelievers.</p>\n<h3>Pariah Roles</h3>\n<p>Though extremely rare, the Imperium seeks out pariahs to serve the Imperium. Most who are discovered are found in orphanages and similar, abandoned by parents who found themselves instinctively disgusted by their child.</p>\n<p>Those who are discovered are a rare and valuable tool in the war for humanity’s survival. The Silent Sisterhood served in this capacity during the Great Crusade and Horus Heresy, and have recently returned in a time of dire need, and both the Inquisition and the Officio Assassinorum employ them to hunt and slay witches and sorcerers.</p>\n<p>However, not all pariahs are so fortunate, and tend to live lives of isolation on the edges of society, often eking out an existence by doing solitary work, or work where the revulsion they inspire is little impediment. A few discover that the extent of their abilities and hire themselves out as freelance witch-hunters and wyrdbanes, or as bodyguards to the paranoid.</p>\n<h3>Playing a Pariah</h3>\n<p>Any Human character may be chosen to be a Pariah during character creation. This has an additional XP cost, and applies additional special abilities to the character, but it also comes with some penalties and restrictions too.</p>\n<p>This additional cost must be paid if you choose any Human archetype. It is already included in the cost of all Pariah archetypes.</p>\n<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 30</p>\n<p><strong>Abhorrent Presence:</strong> +2DN to all interaction tests with non-pariah characters. +4DN to interaction tests with @Item[JVz6FoVEc7p1DJUj]{PSYKERS}.

{"_id":"k3NrlWs4AtUIynfi","name":"Squats","content":"<p>An Abhuman breed from the inhospitable high-gravity worlds near the galactic core, the Squats once ruled empires of their own. Descended from the colonists sent to mine the resource-rich worlds of that region long ago, they were cut off from humanity during the Age of Strife, and evolved to suit their environments, becoming short, solid, and hardy folk.</p>\n<p>The Squats are a tenacious, grim people, hardened by the harsh environments of their stronghold-worlds, but they’re also loyal, hard-working, and honourable, and with an intellect and technical aptitude not often found in Abhumans. Indeed, so successful were they in settling their worlds that by the time the Great Crusades discovered them, they were given permission to remain autonomous of the Imperium, as allies rather than subjects. How they achieved such a feat is lost to time. Even then, the Squats were isolationist and inward-looking, seldom involving themselves in the affairs of the wider galaxy unless the galaxy came to them.</p>\n<p>During the Age of the Imperium, the many Leagues and Strongholds of the Squats saw a slow decline, their civilisation eroded by feuds and grudge-wars, to say nothing of the malign incursions of Xenos breeds – especially the Orks, who seemed to always find the Strongholds an enticing target – and the servants of Chaos. The populations of many failing Strongholds migrated to nearby Imperial worlds, integrating into the Imperium. When the Cicatrix Maledictum opened, tearing the galaxy in two, the Squat Homeworlds were caught within the middle of the rift, and precious few of the remaining Squats survived the cataclysm. Those who remained were offworld in expeditionary groups, were those who had joined the Imperium, or were outcasts and exiles in mercenary bands, and they are far too few to rebuild what they have lost.</p>\n<p>Squats are, as their name suggests, a short, sturdy people. They tend to have hard, broad features, with prominent noses, and male Squats always bear long, thick facial hair, often elaborately braided or styled. Though shorter than most humans, their broad frames and solid bodies suggest that they are far from weak or frail – indeed, the average Squat is more resilient than a baseline human.</p>\n<h3>Squat Roles</h3>\n<p>Squats could be found in all walks of life during the days of their civilisation, and many left the Homeworlds in seek of glory, adventure, or wealth, often aligning themselves with Rogue Traders, Adeptus Mechanicus Explorators, and others who range across the stars. Now, such wandering Squats are all who remain.</p>\n<p>Many Squats are miners and prospectors by trade, but all Squats are trained and armed to defend their homes from aggressors. In addition to being hardy, they’re strong and dextrous, and with unyielding resolve, especially now that they have so little left to lose. Some Squats have taken this to extremes, swearing oaths of vengeance and ruin upon the enemies of their kind, pledging to seek the destruction of those who have harmed the Squats with their dying breaths.</p>\n<p>Squats have a natural aptitude for technology, at least compared to most in the Imperium. Anyone looking at Squat technology in detail would see many things in common with the technology of the Imperium, but also many differences. Squat Engineers and the Priesthood of Mars have a similar technological base—humanity’s technical achievements in the distant past—but they have developed these technologies differently, through different conflicts and struggles, and to suit different circumstances. Millennia of living without the strictures of the Adeptus Mechanicus allowed the Squats to develop technologies unseen within the Imperium, and Squat Master Engineers were able to rival the Magi of Mars in their artifice.</p>\n<h5>Squat Names</h5>\n<p>Many Squat names are traditional, with a recurring use of names used by honoured ancestors from generations past, and often use a patronym or matronym (the name of a parent to indicate lineage) or clan name. Squats often also have a nickname or other earned identifier. Squats don’t get to choose their own nicknames—these are given to them by mentors and superiors during their apprentice years—and young Squats are caught in the tension between standing out enough to get a worthy moniker and not being so outlandish that they receive a shameful one. The following names are examples:</p>\n<p>Algunella, Athgni, Athlun, Balgrimella, Beladokina, Burnir, Burzin, Drokgrimella, Dronglin, Elanya, Elruna, Fimagrin, Fimarun, Gadrinella, Gimzin, Grendl, Grimgrund, Grimtoka, Hakakin, Harmin, Harnina, Kazgrond, Lundor, Moranina, Mori, Odaskina, Olfmir, Ollagona, Ollanya, Ragni, Rorangona, Rorgar, Skagromina, Skoraskina, Skordokina, Snoragund, Throngana, Thuramin, Uthagrund, Zakgni</p>\n<h3>Playing a Squat</h3>\n<p><strong>XP Cost:</strong> 28</p>\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong> 5</p>\n<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> Toughness 3, Willpower 3</p>\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Tech 1, Weapon Skill 2</p>\n<p><strong>Abhuman:</strong> +1DN to all Interaction tests with characters possessing the @Item[c1eM1YGFaqKckprQ]{IMPERIUM} keyword.</p>\n<p><strong>Grudges:</strong> +1d to all melee attacks against characters possessing the @Item[Vf7SDGLw2rcDMTda]{ORK} or @Item[TujuT6TkhTSvZJLF]{CHAOS} keywords. +2DN penalty on all non-hostile Interaction skill tests vs. targets possessing the @Item[Vf7SDGLw2rcDMTda]{ORK} or @Item[TujuT6TkhTSvZJLF]{CHAOS} keywords.</p>\n<p><strong>Legacy of the Cataclysm:</strong> Your Resolve and Conviction increase by +1 each. You begin play with +3 corruption.</p>\n<h5>Additional Details</h5>\n<p><strong>Age:</strong> Squats, with their hardier physiology, tend to live longer lives than baseline humans, and feel the effects of age more slowly; indeed, Squats tend to endure for a similar length of time to Adeptus Astartes, frequently living for two or three centuries if battle, mishap, or illness does not take them first, and some can live for far, far longer. If you’re randomly rolling for a Squat character’s age, roll 4d6 x 5, and then multiply the total by the game’s Tier.</p>\n<p><strong>Colouration:</strong> As an abhuman breed, Squats possess a similar range and variety of skin pigments, hair colours, and eye colours to baseline humans.</p>\n<p><strong>Height:</strong> As their name suggests, Squats are not a tall people. An average Squat stands a little over four feet tall, or around 1.3 metres. If you’re randomly rolling a Squat character’s height, roll 4’ +2d6”.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages:</strong> The Guilder Dialect of the Squats diverged and evolved in isolation since long before the Imperium was ever founded, and while it may once have been based on a human language, that original language is now long dead, though some linguists have noted a possible common ancestry with the language of the tribes of Fenris. What remains is a practical, industrial language, filled with complex jargon and idioms relating to mining, machines, and warfare. Squat characters know the Guilder Dialect language in addition to any others they know.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"QQwHydvBuTROXyXM":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_3l2cf55lq8r","path":"An Abundance of Apocrypha#/CF_SEP/Species","color":"#000000"}}}
