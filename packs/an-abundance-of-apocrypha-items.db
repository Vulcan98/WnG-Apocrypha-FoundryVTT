The Crux Terminatus is almost always worn on the left shoulder pad, though it may also be worn on one knee pad (this is usually done only in combination with the shoulder pad, however). Legend has it that the first Crux Terminatus ever crafted contained a tiny fragment of the Emperor's own armour within it, an honour granted to commemorate a squad of Imperial Fists Terminators who aided the Emperor in the battle against Horus.

The Chapters of the Space Marines are arch traditionalists, and some are conservative in the extreme, having upheld the same warrior traditions for thousands of Terran years. Of course, the express command of Roboute Guilliman as the Lord Commander of the Imperium eased the transition into the new era.</p>\n<p>For the Ultramarines and the vast majority of their Successor Chapters, the word of their risen Primarch was good enough, and many Chapters welcomed the Primaris Battle-Brothers gladly. But there were those especially secretive or wilful Chapters who saw the incorporation of the Primaris Marines into their ranks as a dilution of their gene-stock and a betrayal of their long-held culture.</p>\n<p>Some amongst the Adeptus Astartes suspected that the Primaris Marines, being stronger, more durable and closer in blood to the Primarchs themselves, represented the obsolescence of the traditional Astartes. No amount of reason&mdash;of pointing out that what the Primaris offered in raw ability, they lacked in experience and versatility&mdash;could salve the spiritual wound dealt by the sight of the newcomers wearing their Chapter heraldry.</p>\n<p>The Primaris Marines of the Ultima Founding had been swiftly inducted into brotherhoods that the incepted Aspirants of yesteryear had given everything they had to join. Questions, heavy with the weight of Mankind's destiny, hung in the air. Would the Primaris Marines ultimately render the traditional Space Marines extinct? Would the identity of each Chapter's homeworld be diluted, with so many thousands of new recruits sourced from the stasis vaults of Mars? And was it possible for a Space Marine to be transformed into a Primaris, inheriting the benefits of Adeptus Mechanicus arcanoscience whilst retaining his personality and experience?</p>\n<p>This last question had been raised in Adeptus Astartes Chapters across the galaxy. It was a query Marneus Calgar, Chapter Master of the Ultramarines, had asked of Belisarius Cawl himself, and had discussed with those of his fellow Chapter Masters he was able to meet in person.</p>\n<p>Debate raged as to whether such an act was even possible without having deadly consequences for the recipient -- for data that Archmagos Cawl had already amassed on the subject suggested there would be a 61.6% failure rate at such a transformation until the process could be perfected, which would take time. Then there was the moral concern of whether the process should be attempted at all.</p>\n<p>The dilemma proved divisive. There were those who claimed that this was the ultimate destiny of all Adeptus Astartes, while from other quarters came whispers of rejection, even mutiny, at the prospect.</p>\n<p>The lords of the Ultramarines concluded that to ease the transition from centuries of Imperial tradition to a new order, the theoreticals of that raging debate needed to be put into practice. It was Marneus Calgar who stepped forward as the first test subject from the ranks of his storied Chapter. It was a process he did not survive&mdash;though like his Primarch before him, he was to rise from the threshold of death once more.</p>\n<p>You have chosen to follow this example, and survived the process, emerging anew with greater strength and vitality.</p>","requirements":"Strength 5, Toughness 5, Ballistic Skill 4+, Weapon Skill 4+","keywords":"ADEPTUS ASTARTES, PRIMARIS","influence":1,"benefits":"<p>You become a Primaris Marine.
